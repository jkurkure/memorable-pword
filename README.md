# memorable-pword
Alternate approach to concept of hasher for password. Similar to [password-hasher](https://github.com/jkurkure/password-hasher/), except that simple, real English words are used with special characters for seperation. This allows for passwords of similar difficulty for brute force to break while also being feasible to remember.
