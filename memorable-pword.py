 The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned
to a dead channel.
  `It's not like I'm using,' Case heard someone say, as he
shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the
Chat.  

  The Japanese had already forgotten more neurosurgery than
the Chinese had ever known.  The black clinics of Chiba were
the cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly,
and still they couldn't repair the damage he'd suffered in that
Memphis hotel.
  A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading
nightly.  All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the
corners he'd cut in Night City, and still he'd see the matrix in
his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless
void...  The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the
Pacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cow-
boy.  Just another husler, trying to make it through.  But the
dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo,
and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the
dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands
clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fin-
gers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.
